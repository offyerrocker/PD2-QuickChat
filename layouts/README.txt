These files are here as templates, but you SHOULD NOT EDIT THESE DIRECTLY-
They're the default fallback options for QuickChat to use if there are no other options.
Instead, COPY THEM into the right folder: "/mods/saves/QuickChat/"
And THEN you can edit that copy!

A wiki will be available soon with a list of options.
